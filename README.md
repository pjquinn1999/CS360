The Weight Tracker application was developed to address the growing need for personalized health monitoring tools, specifically focusing on weight management and progress tracking. At its core, the app serves users who want to maintain a consistent record of their weight measurements while receiving meaningful feedback about their progress. The application combines essential features like secure user authentication, detailed weight logging with date tracking, and innovative SMS notifications to keep users engaged with their health goals. The user interface was carefully designed around a bottom navigation pattern, providing easy access to both the weight tracking database and notification settings. Each screen was purposefully crafted to be intuitive and user-friendly, featuring clear input fields for weight entries, a comprehensive history view using RecyclerView, and straightforward notification controls that respect user privacy and platform permissions. The development process followed a systematic approach, starting with the implementation of core data management using SQLite through a robust DatabaseHelper class that handles both user authentication and weight records. The codebase is organized following the Android activity lifecycle pattern, with clear separation between UI components (activities and adapters) and data management (database and application classes). One particular innovation was the integration of SMS notifications with the weight tracking feature, requiring careful handling of Android permissions and user preferences. This feature was implemented using a combination of SharedPreferences for storing user settings and the Android SmsManager for sending notifications, all while maintaining user privacy and data security. Testing was conducted throughout the development process, with particular attention paid to the database operations and permission handling. Each feature was tested independently, from user registration and login to weight entry management and notification systems. The SQLite database implementation was thoroughly tested to ensure proper data persistence and retrieval, while the SMS notification system was verified across different permission scenarios to guarantee robust functionality. The application's architecture proved particularly successful in the weight tracking component, where the combination of RecyclerView for displaying weight history, MaterialButton for user interactions, and DatePickerDialog for date selection created a seamless and intuitive user experience. The codebase demonstrates strong knowledge of Android development principles, including proper activity lifecycle management, efficient database operations, and thoughtful implementation of user-centered design patterns.
